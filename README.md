I am pursuing Btech in Computer Science while exploring different things. I am very grateful that one of my mentors introduced me to few technical jargons like Blockchain, AWS, Web3, AI, etc. At that moment, some spark incited within me to explore these jargon.
From that moment I started working in the field of computer science which taught me many things like 
• One should have to be patient so as to debug your code 
• Need to work in a team if you wanna achieve wonders and make some awesome products 
• Sacrifice your selfishness to write good maintainable code for peer engineers. 
• Value your's as well as the user's time by writing optimized code 
• One should communicate well with clients/managers to write and document the business requirements before moving on to the code 
• Try to be a problem solver for eg:- I created a store locator app in which a particular company may put all of their stores on Google Maps and users can easily locate and search them on Google Maps. 
• Never hesitate to google anything, overall it's your best teacher ;)
